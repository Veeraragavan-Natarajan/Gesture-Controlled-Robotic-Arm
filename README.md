# Gesture-Controlled-Robotic-Arm
This project demonstrates a gesture control system where a human hand is tracked using a camera, and the extracted hand movements are mapped in software to control a 5DOF robotic arm.  Unlike glove-based systems, this project uses pure computer vision to detect and interpret bare-hand gestures, making the system intuitive, low-cost, and scalable.
